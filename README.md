# DART IPs

This repository has a list of ready-to-use hardware IPs for DART.

## Summary of IPs

[//]: <> (This is also a comment.)

The following table summarizes the existing IPs and some of their features.
The columns refer to the existance of software example, the IP hardware description language, if it has a testbench, and if it has been tested in FPGA.

| IP name       | sw ex. | hw lang | tb | FPGA |
|---------------|--------|---------|----|------|
| FIR           |    Y   |    N    |    |      |
| memcpy        |        |         |    |      |
| amalthea_prem |        |         |    |      |
| amalthea_pipe |        |         |    |      |
| mat_mult      |        |         |    |      |
|               |        |         |    |      |

## IP guidelines and structure

All IPs should follow these guidelines and this structure in order to reuse the scripts and minimize the integration issues with DART and FRED.

### Guidelines

 - this repo must not have automatically genereted files, like files generated by synthesis tools. Use the scripts instead to recreate the design;

### Structure 

All IPs must have the following directory structure: 
 
   
```
.
├── hw
│   ├── build.tcl
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── memcpy.cpp
│   │   └── ...
│   └── tb
│       ├── tb.cpp
│       └── ...
├── readme.md
└── sw
    ├── Makefile
    └── src
        ├── memcpy.cpp
        └── ...
```   

 - the *readme.md* file documents the IP, including usage information, configuration parameters, etc;
 - the file *hw/build.tcl* is a script synthesis for Vivado (for Verilog or VHDL sources) or for Vivado HLS (for cpp sources). This script refers to the common synthesis script located at the *scripts* directory, at same level of the IP directory;
 - the *sw/Makefile* compiles the example application for the IP;
