# AMALTHEA PIPE IP

This IP is used with the AMALTHEA design flow to mimic the behavior of a generic hardware accelerator. The user can configure:

 - the number of bytes read by the IP;
 - the number of clock cycles the IP spend executing some dommy logic; and
 - the number of bytes written by the IP to the host CPU;

This IP is called PIPE because it executes in parallel (i.e. like a pipeline) read, execution, write operations.
